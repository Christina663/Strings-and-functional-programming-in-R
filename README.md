# Strings-and-functional-programming-in-R

This is the last assignment of STAT 545B! Way to go!

In this assignment, we investigate the Strings and functional programming in R using packages like purrr. We completed two exercises, one to compute word frequency in a Jane Austin book, 
the other to explore the dataset "ChickWeight" and the relationship between different diets and the speed of weight growth of chickens.
